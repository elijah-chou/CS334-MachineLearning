# Machine-Learning-Final-Project:ICU-Mortality-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

This repository contains Python scripts and related files from the group project I worked on in my CS 334 Machine Learning class at Emory University taught by Dr. Li Xiong. This project was worked on jointly by Tianqi Bao, Tiantian Li, and myself. Together, we wanted to see if we could put together a better ICU Mortality predictor than the Linear Regression model in some existing literature. Overall, we did some exploratory data analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, preprocessed the data with various feature selection and hyperparameter tuning techniques, then fit the data through various other models (such as logistic regression, lasso regression, etc.) and compared their AUROCs against the original model for model evaluation. The proposal, presentation, and final paper can be found within this repository as well. 

Note: In compliance with access to the MIMIC-IV data, the original, raw data was not included in this repository. Please consult their main website if access to original data is needed.
