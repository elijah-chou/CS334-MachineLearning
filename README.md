# Machine-Learning-Final-Project

This repository contains code and related files from the group project I worked on in my CS 334 Machine Learning class. This project was worked on jointly by Tianqi Bao, Tiantian Li, and myself. Together, we wanted to see if we could put together a better ICU Mortality predictor than the Linear Regression model in some existing literature. Overall, we did some exploratory data analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, preprocessed the data with various feature selection and data normalization techniques, then fit the data through various other models (such as logistic regression, lasso regression, etc.) and compared their AUROCs against the original model. The proposal, presentation, and final paper can be found within this repository as well.
